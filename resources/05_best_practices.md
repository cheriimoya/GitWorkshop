Tips, tricks and best practices
===

~~~

## Commit messages
- please write useful messages
- messages should hint what the commit is doing
- title shouldn't be longer than 50 characters
- empty line between title and body
- you can link a commit to an issue ('#34' or 'GIT-3141')
- always continue the sentence
```
'If applied, this commit will...'
```

~~~

## Frequency
- different people say different things
- rather commit often
- commits can be 'squashed' later

~~~

## Use .gitignores
- for excluding binary files
- for excluding 'secret' files
